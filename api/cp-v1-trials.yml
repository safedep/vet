    Trials API provide a way for obtaining an API Key for data plane service access
    using an Email Address. Trials is different from Registrations as the later
    allows full access to the control plane while Trials is meant to allow access
    only to a time bounded (expirable) API key for quick evaluation of tools.

        Register a trial user to obtain an expirable API Key. The API key will
        be generated and sent to the user over Email to ensure validity and access
        to the email by the requester. System defined limits will be applied to
        maximum number of trial API keys that can be generated for an email.
