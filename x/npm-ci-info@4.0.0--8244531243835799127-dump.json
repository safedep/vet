The sole evidence is a YARA rule match on an unusual top-level domain (TLD) within the `README.md` file: `https://www.go.cd/`.  YARA rules are inherently noisy and prone to false positives, especially when dealing with simple string matching. The fact that the match is in the `README.md` file, which is a descriptive file, further weakens the evidence.  A link to `go.cd` is not inherently malicious; it could simply be a reference to a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) server, which is relevant to a package named `ci-info`.  The lack of other supporting evidence, such as LLM analysis or suspicious code within the package itself, makes it highly improbable that this single YARA match indicates malicious behavior.  The project's GitHub presence with a moderate number of stars and forks does not suggest malicious intent.  Without stronger evidence, labeling this package as malware would be a false positive."

The sole evidence is a YARA rule match on an unusual top-level domain (TLD) within the `README.md` file: `https://www.go.cd/`.  YARA rules are inherently noisy and prone to false positives, especially when dealing with simple string matching. The fact that the match is in the `README.md` file, which is a descriptive file, further weakens the evidence.  A link to `go.cd` is not inherently malicious; it could simply be a reference to a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) server, which is relevant to a package named `ci-info`.  The lack of other supporting evidence, such as LLM analysis or suspicious code within the package itself, makes it highly improbable that this single YARA match indicates malicious behavior.  The project's GitHub presence with a moderate number of stars and forks does not suggest malicious intent.  Without stronger evidence, labeling this package as malware would be a false positive."
