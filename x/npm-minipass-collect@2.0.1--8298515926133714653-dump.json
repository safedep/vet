Low popularity does not automatically equate to maliciousness; it could simply reflect a niche or less widely adopted package. The absence of other evidence, such as suspicious code behavior detected by LLM analysis or YARA matches (despite acknowledging their limitations), prevents a conclusive malware determination.  Further investigation, including static and dynamic analysis of the package's code, is necessary to reach a definitive conclusion.",

Evidence 0 highlights an 'Untrustworthy source project' due to low popularity and OpenSSF score. However, this is a low-confidence assessment and does not definitively indicate malicious intent.  Low popularity does not automatically equate to maliciousness; it could simply reflect a niche or less widely adopted package. The absence of other evidence, such as suspicious code behavior detected by LLM analysis or YARA matches (despite acknowledging their limitations), prevents a conclusive malware determination.  Further investigation, including static and dynamic analysis of the package's code, is necessary to reach a definitive conclusion.",
