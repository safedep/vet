Evidence 0 highlights that the project has only released four versions. While this *could* indicate immaturity or lack of maintenance, it's not definitive proof of malicious intent.  Many legitimate open-source projects start with few releases and gradually increase their version count over time.  The low number of stars and forks on GitHub (22 stars, 8 forks) suggests a relatively small and potentially less scrutinized project, increasing the risk, but again, this is not conclusive evidence of malicious behavior.  The absence of other evidence, such as suspicious code analysis (LLM or YARA results), file content analysis, or behavioral indicators, prevents a definitive malware classification.  More comprehensive analysis is needed before a conclusion can be reached."

Evidence 0 highlights that the project has only released four versions. While this *could* indicate immaturity or lack of maintenance, it's not definitive proof of malicious intent.  Many legitimate open-source projects start with few releases and gradually increase their version count over time.  The low number of stars and forks on GitHub (22 stars, 8 forks) suggests a relatively small and potentially less scrutinized project, increasing the risk, but again, this is not conclusive evidence of malicious behavior.  The absence of other evidence, such as suspicious code analysis (LLM or YARA results), file content analysis, or behavioral indicators, prevents a definitive malware classification.  More comprehensive analysis is needed before a conclusion can be reached."
