Evidence 0 points to an untrustworthy source project due to low popularity (3 stars, 1 fork) and a low OpenSSF score. While low popularity can be an indicator of potential risk, it's not definitive proof of malicious intent. Many legitimate, niche packages have low community engagement.  The lack of further evidence, such as suspicious code analysis (LLM or otherwise), behavioral analysis, or identification of malicious functionality, prevents a conclusive malware classification.  The absence of positive findings from YARA scans (noted as noisy and unreliable) and LLM analysis (when available) further weakens the case for malicious behavior.  A low OpenSSF score alone is not sufficient to label a package as malware; it suggests further investigation is needed, but doesn't provide sufficient evidence to confirm maliciousness.",

Evidence 0 points to an untrustworthy source project due to low popularity (3 stars, 1 fork) and a low OpenSSF score. While low popularity can be an indicator of potential risk, it's not definitive proof of malicious intent. Many legitimate, niche packages have low community engagement.  The lack of further evidence, such as suspicious code analysis (LLM or otherwise), behavioral analysis, or identification of malicious functionality, prevents a conclusive malware classification.  The absence of positive findings from YARA scans (noted as noisy and unreliable) and LLM analysis (when available) further weakens the case for malicious behavior.  A low OpenSSF score alone is not sufficient to label a package as malware; it suggests further investigation is needed, but doesn't provide sufficient evidence to confirm maliciousness.",
