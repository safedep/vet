Low popularity and few versions can simply reflect a small, niche project or a recently published one that hasn't yet gained traction.  The absence of additional evidence, such as suspicious code analysis, unusual file contents, or reported malicious activity, prevents a conclusion of malware.  The analysis lacks crucial information such as LLM-based file analysis results or YARA scan results (even though we acknowledge their limitations).

While Evidence 0 highlights a small number of published versions, and Evidence 1 points to a low OpenSSF score and lack of popularity for the project, neither constitutes definitive proof of malicious intent.  Low popularity and few versions can simply reflect a small, niche project or a recently published one that hasn't yet gained traction.  The absence of additional evidence, such as suspicious code analysis, unusual file contents, or reported malicious activity, prevents a conclusion of malware.  The analysis lacks crucial information such as LLM-based file analysis results or YARA scan results (even though we acknowledge their limitations).  Without further data, it's premature to label this package as malware.",
