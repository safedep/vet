## Policy as Code for Open Source Software Supply Chain

`vet` is a tool for identifying risks in open source software supply chain. It
goes beyond just vulnerabilities and provides visibility on OSS package risks
due to it's license, popularity, security hygiene, and more. `vet` is designed
with the goal of helping software development teams consume safe and trusted
OSS components through automated vetting in CI/CD.

![vet Demo](docs/static/img/vet/vet-demo.gif)

## Getting Started

- Download the binary file for your operating system / architecture from the [Official GitHub Releases](https://github.com/safedep/vet/releases)

- You can also install `vet` using homebrew in MacOS and Linux

```bash
brew tap safedep/tap
brew install safedep/tap/vet
```

- Alternatively, build from source

> Ensure $(go env GOPATH)/bin is in your $PATH

```bash
go install github.com/safedep/vet@latest
```

- Also available as a container image

```bash
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/safedep/vet:latest version
```

> **Note:** Container image is built for x86_64 Linux only. Use a
> [pre-built binary](https://github.com/safedep/vet/releases) or
> build from source for other platforms.

### Running Scan

- Run `vet` to identify risks by scanning a directory

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/repository
```

![vet scan directory](docs/static/img/vet/vet-scan-directory.png)

- Run `vet` to scan specific (supported) package manifests

```bash
vet scan -M /path/to/pom.xml
vet scan -M /path/to/requirements.txt
vet scan -M /path/to/package-lock.json
```

**Note:** `--lockfiles` is generalized to `-M` or `--manifests` to support additional
types of package manifests or other artifacts in future.

#### Scanning Binary Artifacts

- Scan a Java JAR file

```bash
vet scan -M /path/to/app.jar
```

> Suitable for scanning bootable JARs with embedded dependencies

- Scan a directory with JAR files

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/jars --type jar
```

#### Scanning SBOM

- Scan an SBOM in [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) format

```bash
vet scan -M /path/to/cyclonedx-sbom.json --type bom-cyclonedx
```

- Scan an SBOM in [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) format

```bash
vet scan -M /path/to/spdx-sbom.json --type bom-spdx
```

**Note:** `--type` is a generalized version of `--lockfile-as` to support additional
artifact types in future.

> **Note:** SBOM scanning feature is currently in experimental stage

#### Scanning Github Repositories

- Setup github access token to scan private repo

```bash
vet connect github
```

Alternatively, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with [Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

- To scan remote Github repositories, including private ones

```bash
vet scan --github https://github.com/safedep/vet
```

**Note:** You may need to enable [Dependency Graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph) at repository or organization level for Github repository scanning to work.

#### Scanning Github Organization

> You must setup the required access for scanning private repositories
> before scanning organizations

```bash
vet scan --github-org https://github.com/safedep
```

> **Note:** `vet` will block and wait if it encounters Github secondary rate limit.

#### Scanning Package URL

- To scan a [purl](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)

```bash
vet scan --purl pkg:/gem/nokogiri@1.10.4
```

#### Available Parsers

- List supported package manifest parsers including experimental modules

```bash
vet scan parsers --experimental
```

## Policy as Code

`vet` uses [Common Expressions Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec)
(CEL) as the policy language. Policies can be defined to build guardrails
preventing introduction of insecure components.

### Vulnerability

- Run `vet` and fail if a critical or high vulnerability was detected

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code \
    --filter 'vulns.critical.exists(p, true) || vulns.high.exists(p, true)' \
    --filter-fail
```

### License

- Run `vet` and fail if a package with a specific license was detected

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code \
    --filter 'licenses.exists(p, "GPL-2.0")' \
    --filter-fail
```

**Note:** Using `licenses.contains_license(...)` is recommended for license matching due
to its support for SPDX expressions.

- `vet` supports [SPDX License Expressions](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/) at package license and policy level

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code \
    --filter 'licenses.contains_license("LGPL-2.1+")' \
    --filter-fail
```

### Scorecard

- Run `vet` and fail based on [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) attributes

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code \
    --filter 'scorecard.scores.Maintained == 0' \
    --filter-fail
```

For more examples, refer to [documentation](https://docs.safedep.io/advanced/policy-as-code)

## Query Mode

- Run scan and dump internal data structures to a file for further querying

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code --json-dump-dir /path/to/dump
```

- Filter results using `query` command

```bash
vet query --from /path/to/dump \
    --filter 'vulns.critical.exists(p, true) || vulns.high.exists(p, true)'
```

- Generate report from dumped data

```bash
vet query --from /path/to/dump --report-json /path/to/report.json
```

## Reporting

`vet` supports generating reports in multiple formats during `scan` or `query`
execution.

| Format   | Description                                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Markdown | Human readable report for vulnerabilities, licenses, and more                  |
| CSV      | Export data to CSV format for manual slicing and dicing                        |
| JSON     | Machine readable JSON format following internal schema (maximum data)          |
| SARIF    | Useful for integration with Github Code Scanning and other tools               |
| Graph    | Dependency graph in DOT format for risk and package relationship visualization |
| Summary  | Default console report with summary of vulnerabilities, licenses, and more     |

## CI/CD Integration

### üì¶ GitHub Action

- `vet` is available as a GitHub Action, refer to [vet-action](https://github.com/safedep/vet-action)

### üöÄ GitLab CI

- `vet` can be integrated with GitLab CI, refer to [vet-gitlab-ci](https://docs.safedep.io/integrations/gitlab-ci)

## üêô Malicious Package Analysis

`vet` supports scanning for malicious packages using [SafeDep Cloud API](https://docs.safedep.io/cloud/malware-analysis)

- Run a scan and check for malicious packages

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code --malware
```

**Note**: `vet` will submit identified packages to SafeDep Cloud for analysis and wait
for a `timeout` period for response. Not all package analysis may be completed
within the timeout period. However, subsequent scans will fetch the results if
available and lead to increased coverage over time. Adjust the timeout using
`--malware-analysis-timeout` flag.
