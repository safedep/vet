## Bitbucket Code Insights Report

`vet` supports creation of Bitbucket specific reports:

1. `report-bitbucket-meta` creates the Summary / Meta report json artifact
2. `report-bitbucket-annotations` creates the per file basiss annotations for vulnerability, malware, violations and threats.

These two flags can be used independently, depending on what to generate.
