# Diff "Doc Generate"

The `./scripts/diff_docgen.sh` script is used in CI to check if the [./docs/manual/gen](./docs/manual/gen) is out of sync or not.

Due to some reasons dynamic lines generated by `cobra/doc` we have to use `Ignore Patterns`.

Reasons:

- `Enum` values can change the order, example if a cli flag support enums values, like [`PYTHON`, GO`,`JAVA`], hence then we can't guarantee the order of these values, so diff may show a change.

- _"Auto generated by cobra on [DATE]"_ line can change when ever we generate with the latest date.

```bash
# Define ignore patterns for diff (lines to ignore during comparison)
IGNORE_PATTERNS=(
  "^Auto generated by spf13/cobra on"
  "--lang stringArray.*Source code languages to analyze (default \[.*\])"
)
```

Add your `ignore pattern` when you there is a diff on some dynamic line.
